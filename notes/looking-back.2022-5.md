This is my first attempt at creating a monthly journal as a way to reflect on things and see how I've progressed. I was inspired to do this by [Nikita Voloboev's Site](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/looking-back/). He has a really developed second brain made with Docusaurus that I thought was really cool to explore, may have to try out [Docusaursus](https://docusaurus.io/) at some point. Not sure how I feel about mdx, but it's definitely worth looking into.

Speaking of markdown, seems like it has a lot of momentum right now. Stripe just released [MarkDoc](https://markdoc.io/), and I've seen cool tools such as [SlideDev](https://sli.dev/), [Marp](https://marp.app/), [More](https://github.com/mundimark/awesome-markdown). One thing I often used it for in school was making cheatsheets for exams (when allowed) using markdown + katex for the content, and pandoc + word for the formatting. This let me put as much info as I needed without any issue. Some examples of those are below. ![[compsci.discrete-structures#cheat-sheets]]

This month, I finally finished my first year of college. I got most of my hard/time-consuming classes out of the way, so hopefully it should be smooth sailing from here on out. I'm pretty happy overall with how the year went, but I definitely should not have taken 19 credit hours second semester. I was in way over my head between that, wrestling club, BDAA, and FEH in particular, but was somehow able to make it out with minimal impact to my GPA. I did end up getting a B+ in Software II, a class I was supposed to be really good at but I guess it was deserved due to a mixture of not dedicating enough time to it and overestimating my abilities. Other than school, I think I had a pretty good academic-fun ballance, with an exception of when I was in the midst of wrestling season.

Now that school's over, I've been spending most of my time between working, lifting, and doing a little work on one of the projects I've been putting off, specifically the open source learning resources one. I'm calling it Open Learn and have been working on making it in Django with my younger brother. Hopefully I'll finish that and get to some of the other projects on my list ![[what-im-doing#ideas-i-need-to-get-to]]
